api call to append to table of contents - api/monsters
these will need an attach listeners method so they go to the proper api call

append to it's section in the for loop
let monsterName = arr.results[i].name;


create a variable that takes the id.text so that it can have the monster service api function
so that on click, only targets that specific id, instead of the entire class.
